# Client App

This app is generated by `create-react-app`.

## Container Vs Component

Please read more about these topics in this nice
[article](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

### Component (a.k.a presentational components)

* Concerned with how things look
* May contain both presentational and container components inside, and usually
    have some DOM markup and styles of their own.
* Often allow containment via `this.props.children`.
* Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores.
* Don't specify how the data is loaded or mutated.
* Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props.
* Rarely have their own state (Why they do, it's UI state rather than data).
* Are written as `functional components` unless they need state, lifecycle
    hooks, or performance optimizations.

### Container (a.k.a smart components)

* Are concerned with how things work.
* May contain both presentational and container comoponents inside but usually
    don't have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and
    never have any styles.
* Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.
* Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational
    components.
* Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources.
* Are usually geneated using `high order components` such as connect() from
    React Redux, `createContainer()` from Rely, or `Container.create()` from
    Flux Utils, rather than written by hand.

### When to introduce containers:

As the article suggest, just start with your `components` first. Eventually
you'll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate
components. When you notice that some components don't use the props they
receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those
intermediate components any time the children need more data, it's a good time
to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the
behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unreleated
components in the middle of the tree.
